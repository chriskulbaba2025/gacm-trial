# GACM Trial — Current State

## Authoritative repository

`chriskulbaba2025/gacm-trial`

## Repository identity

The checked-out repository `HEAD` is the authoritative repository commit identity.

The exact SHA must be obtained from Git at execution time. This file defines governed project state and does not duplicate the SHA of the commit that contains it.

Before governed work begins, execution must verify the local `HEAD` against the intended remote and/or explicitly authorized `HEAD` identity.

## Authoritative implementation PRD

`GACM_IMPLEMENTATION_PRD_V1.0.md`

## Methodology status

GACM v4.2.2 is treated as FROZEN methodology authority. This repository is for Pilot v1 implementation and evidence, not methodology redesign.

## Current phase

**Phase 14: COMPLETE (PASS)**

Phases 1–13 are complete and recorded as PASS. Phase 14 is resuming from its previously blocked state after the authoritative SPEC baseline was reconciled.

## Phase history

- Phase 11 — Promotion / Rollback State Machine: **PASS** — commit `9c5fdc0eab0d22a4066a4f1d4cfb72b231901c53`
- Phase 12 — Post-Promotion Settle / Observation Gate: **PASS**
- Phase 13 — Pilot Harness: **PASS**
- Phase 14 — Real Project Pilot: **BLOCKED (historical)** — the former authoritative spec-skill baseline lacked the existing validators required by the selected work unit; that authority discrepancy is now resolved.
- Phase 14 — Real Project Pilot: **PASS** — exact SPEC candidate `30bfb0e78bab11c1e20cdc74b45530114c431654` was explicitly approved by Chris Kulbaba, promoted to SPEC `main`, independently verified, and SETTLED. Product repair cycles: 0; repair-process findings: 0.

## Current objective

The authoritative SPEC baseline was `1264a0d4bf0bf4423f116126039bf695671aa91e`. The exact approved candidate `30bfb0e78bab11c1e20cdc74b45530114c431654` is now the promoted SPEC `main` identity. Chris Kulbaba provided explicit human promotion approval for Phase 14 SPEC readiness candidate promotion only. Independent verification PASS and post-promotion SETTLE are complete. Historical BLOCKED and HUMAN GATE states remain preserved in durable evidence. Phase 15 remains unauthorized.

## Completed phases

The Phase 1 control-layer audit, Phase 2 durable run-state schema, Phase 3 GitHub Authority Resolver, Phase 4 Graphify Discovery Adapter, Phase 5 Authoritative Operational Context Resolver, Phase 6 Deterministic Model Router, Phase 7 GCU Execution Adapter, Phase 8 Independent Verification Engine, Phase 9 Repair-Scope / Dependency Logic, Phase 10 Placeholder and Identity Validator, Phase 11 Promotion / Rollback State Machine, Phase 12 SETTLE gate, and Phase 13 Pilot Harness are complete. Their artifacts and completion proofs remain the evidence for the recorded PASS states.

## Historical Phase 1 requirements

The Phase 1 audit was required to cover every control:

1. Control ID
2. Control statement
3. Failure prevented
4. Current/assumed enforcement layer
5. Correct enforcement layer
6. Whether the model can bypass it
7. Whether stale memory can bypass it
8. Whether ambiguity can bypass it
9. Required machine enforcement
10. Required evidence/proof
11. Dependencies on other controls
12. Implementation priority

The audit explicitly covered:

- GitHub authority
- Graphify discovery only, never authority
- authoritative operational context resolution
- account / tenant / environment / region / repository identity
- placeholder prevention
- model routing
- GCU execution boundaries
- independent verification
- bounded repair
- affected-scope re-verification
- broader requalification triggers
- durable run state
- rollback
- SETTLE
- human authority
- continuation across chats/sessions without chat memory

## Historical Phase 1 stop condition

No code, Graphify integration, model routing, or orchestration was to be implemented during Phase 1. Any contradiction preventing deterministic control placement was to be documented and stopped rather than resolved by silently choosing a design.

## Phase 12 gate

Phase 12 requires Phase 11 `SETTLE_REQUIRED`, exact promoted identity, preserved prior authority, valid rollback target, and unchanged authority continuity. It is complete and does not authorize Phase 13.

Preserve repository HEAD as the runtime-authoritative repository identity, GitHub as durable authority, Graphify as discovery only, and frozen GACM v4.2.2 methodology.

## Phase 13 gate

Phase 13 is orchestration integration only. The Pilot Harness coordinates existing controls, preserves durable evidence, supports resume and bounded repair, respects human promotion authority, and does not start a real project or integrate Hermes.

## Phase 14 promotion and settlement

The promoted SPEC identity is `30bfb0e78bab11c1e20cdc74b45530114c431654` on local and remote `main`. The candidate changed only `scripts/spec_readiness.py` and `tests/test_spec_readiness.py`; authoritative validators and forbidden surfaces were preserved. Explicit human approval, independent verification, promotion, and SETTLE receipts are recorded in the durable Phase 14 run state. Rollback target remains `1264a0d4bf0bf4423f116126039bf695671aa91e`; rollback did not occur.

## Next authorized action

No Phase 15 action is authorized. Preserve the settled Phase 14 state and evidence. Any future work requires a separately governed authorization.


## Permanent governance correction — generalization

On 2026-09-20, human authority explicitly authorized a governance-system correction establishing `GACM-GENERALIZATION-AND-WHOLE-SYSTEM-GATE`. This authorization is additive to the historical phase record and supersedes the prior methodology freeze only for this control correction.

Future governed product-repair runs must freeze a product-level definition of done and connected-system map before execution, preserve that acceptance boundary, require independent generalized evidence before promotion, separate fresh-input generalization from reference regression, scan for fixture dependencies, and fail closed on missing generalization proof.

Permanent escape classes: `FIXTURE_TARGET_COLLAPSE` and `SEQUENTIAL_BLOCKER_TUNNELING`.

The machine enforcement implementation lives in `src/gacm/generalization/`, the Pilot Harness pre-execution and pre-promotion gates, PromotionEligibility, and the durable run-state schema release 1.1.0 controls.

## Permanent governance correction — external provider authority

On 2026-09-30, human authority explicitly authorized an additive universal governance correction establishing `GACM-EXTERNAL-PROVIDER-AUTHORITY-AND-CREDENTIAL-PROVENANCE-GATE`.

Permanent failure patterns:

- `EXTERNAL_PROVIDER_AUTHORITY_UNDER_SPECIFICATION`
- `CREDENTIAL_PROVENANCE_UNDER_SPECIFICATION`

Future governed authenticated external actions must prove provider/service authority and credential provenance before network execution. Ambient/global credentials and provider discovery are diagnostic only and may not become configuration automatically. Provider substitution is HOLD unless explicitly authorized. Paid-call authorization does not select or authorize a provider.

The gate must execute before parity/currentness so a self-consistent but unauthorized provider configuration cannot pass by internal consistency alone.

Durable handoff/restart state must preserve the non-secret governed provider identity and authority reference.
